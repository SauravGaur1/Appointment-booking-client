# Thinking Log: Appointment Booking Frontend

## Project Overview

I set out to build a modern, scalable appointment booking frontend using Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. The goal was to create a seamless experience for both professionals and clients, with robust authentication, slot management, public profile browsing, and booking features, all communicating with a Node.js/Express/MongoDB backend via REST APIs.

## What I Built

- **Authentication**: Implemented secure registration and login with protected routes using React Context and token-based auth.
- **Public Profiles**: Users can browse professionals and view their available slots, grouped and sorted for clarity.
- **Slot Management**: Professionals can create, view, and manage their slots. I ensured no overlapping slots can be created, which required careful client-side and backend validation.
- **Booking System**: Clients can book available slots, with real-time UI updates and clear feedback.
- **My Bookings**: Users have a dedicated page to view all their bookings, grouped by date and professional.
- **Dashboard & Profile**: Centralized navigation and profile management for a consistent user experience.
- **UI/UX**: Built a clean, responsive interface with light/dark mode, reusable components, and user-friendly error handling.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Slot Overlap Prevention**: Ensuring slots don’t overlap was tricky. I handled this by checking for conflicts before allowing slot creation, both on the frontend and by expecting backend validation.
- **Consistent State Management**: Managing auth state and API errors across pages required a robust context setup and careful use of React hooks.
- **API Integration**: Mapping backend data (especially for bookings and slots) to the UI, including grouping and sorting, took some iteration to get right.
- **Protected Routes**: Ensuring only authenticated users could access certain pages was solved with a custom `ProtectedRoute` component.
- **UI Consistency**: Keeping the look and feel consistent across all pages meant building and reusing UI components and adhering to a design system.
- **GitHub & Deployment**: Managed git user config, SSH/HTTPS, and pushed to GitHub. Deployed the app to Vercel for live testing.

## How I Tackled the Project

I started by scaffolding the project with Next.js and setting up Tailwind for styling. I built out the authentication flow first, then moved on to the main user flows: public profiles, slot management, and booking. I iteratively added features, tested API integration, and refined the UI. Throughout, I focused on code reusability, error handling, and a smooth user experience. I documented the process and ensured the app was ready for deployment.

## Conclusion

This project was a solid exercise in building a full-featured, production-ready frontend. I’m satisfied with the result and the engineering decisions made along the way. The app is robust, user-friendly, and ready for real-world use.
